<a id="mvc" class="anchor" href="#mvc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MVC</h3>

<p>This assignment was completed using ASP/.Net's MVC also known as Model, View, Controller.  When using this framework you start by creating a model.  The model allows you to structure the type of information that the user will be entering.  It allows you to add fields that are required, set restrictions on each, and even give drop-down selections.  The model represents and data, and does not depend on the view or controller.  The controller takes the information from the model and performs operations on the data, or interprets button clicks or other actions from the view.  The view displays the model data and sends user actions to the controller.</p>

<h4>
<a id="hot-dog-lover-model" class="anchor" href="#hot-dog-lover-model" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hot Dog Lover Model</h4>

<p>The model I created is called Lover.  It represents the data of a Hot Dog Lover.  It includes their favorite hot dog, the last hot dog they ate, a short biography, and the last date they ate a hot dog.</p>

<h4>
<a id="hot-dog-lover-controller" class="anchor" href="#hot-dog-lover-controller" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hot Dog Lover Controller</h4>

<p>I then created a Hot Dog Lover Controller with Views, using Entity Framework.  Creating the a controller this way automatically creates a view for the controller to interact with.  You can then customize the actions of the controller to your liking as well as the view.</p>

<h4>
<a id="hot-dog-lover-view" class="anchor" href="#hot-dog-lover-view" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hot Dog Lover View</h4>

<p>Once I had created the Controller with Views, I was able to go in and edit the auto-generated view.  I changed a few small things about the information that was displayed on the index page of the Lovers view, and then redesigned the entire Details view.</p>
